<pre class="prettyprint lang-genexus" style="max-width: 100%">
The last reorganization has failed and you are trying to execute a different reorganization.
Unexpected errors may occur if you don't try to finalize previous reorganization before running this one.
If you want to run this reorganization anyway, use 'ignoreresume' parameter.</pre>

<p><strong>Cause</strong>: A reorganization (we will name it <i>reorgStep1</i>) was executed and failed; then some change was done to the GeneXus Database model (surely trying to' fix' the <i>reorgSetup1</i> failure). A new reorganization (we will name it <i>reorgStep2</i>) is executed and the detailed error occurs.</p>

<p>The <a href="5288.html">GeneXus reorganization</a> executing the <i>reorgStep2</i> could detect an inconsistency (due to the <i>reorgStep1</i> previous reorganization error) during the schema verification (done to avoid failures) and the error message is displayed.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong>: There is no recipe for this error because it depends on several factors; check the following guidelines:</p>

<p>When a reorganization fails (in this case both <i>reorgStep1</i> and <i>reorgStep2</i> failed) the following options should checked:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Try to understand why the reorganization failed, solve the problem trying not to modify the GeneXus database model and run again the reorganization.<br />
	In this case several reorganization generations will execute the same GeneXus Code; a sample of this error is login or connection problem with the DBMS, generally you modify the Database preferences and the reorganization is regenerated and executed until succeeded.</li>
	<li>Figure out why the reorganization failed, modify the GeneXus database model to solve the problem and execute the reorganization again.<br />
	In this case the reorganization may detail the above error because there is a mismatch between de GeneXus Schema model and the database one; to solve the problem you could:
	<ul>
		<li>Use the <a href="9016.html">-ignoreresume</a> parameter in the <i>Reorganization Options</i> property to bypass the default validation done by GeneXus and run the reorganization process from the very beginning.<br />
		If the <i>reorgStep1</i> reorganization did a change in the database the <a href="9016.html">-ignoreresume</a> parameter, your reorganization may still not work because the target database has some change that GeneXus is not aware of; you will have to restore a Database Backup and rerun the reorganization.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
