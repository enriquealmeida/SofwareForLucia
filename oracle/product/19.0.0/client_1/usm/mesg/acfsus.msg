05085, 0, "cannot start replication because incompatible ACFS features already exist"
// *Cause:  An attempt to initialize replication was rejected because the file
//          system was in a state incompatible with replication.  Possible
//          causes include:
//          1. The file system was not formatted with 512-byte metadata blocks,
//             or the file system was compressed.
//          2. The file system was frozen.
// *Action: If the file system was frozen, run 'acfsutil thaw <mount-point>' and
//          then retry the operation.  Otherwise, migration to newer replication
//          infrastructure must be performed.  Refer to the Oracle Product

// *Action: Rename the problematic files so that their absolute path names
//          are shorter than the limit, and retry the command.
05922, 0, "One or more files under primary mount point '%s' was not replicated because its path name exceeded %d characters.  The first such file was in directory '%s' and had name '%s'."
// *Cause:  ACFS replication did not replicate the primary correctly
//          because one or more files located under the indicated mount
//          point had an absolute path name longer than the indicated
//          limit.  Any files with path names exceeding the limit were not
//          replicated.  The directory and basename of the first such file
//          found are shown in the message, but there may be many others.
// *Action: Rename the problematic files so that their absolute path names
//          are shorter than the limit.  Once each file has been renamed,
//          the next later replication operation will automatically
//          transfer the file.
05923, 0, "unable to apply the incremental snapshot duplication stream because no initial snapshot duplication stream has been applied"
// *Cause:  An attempt to apply an incremental snapshot duplication stream failed
//          because no preceding initial snapshot duplication stream has been applied to
//          the snapshot duplication target.
// *Action: Apply an initial snapshot duplication stream to the target using 'acfsutil
//          snapshot duplicate create' without the -i option to create the initial
//          snapshot duplication stream.
05924, 0, "unable to apply the incremental snapshot duplication stream because its starting snapshot does not match the final snapshot used to create the most recently applied snapshot duplication stream"
// *Cause:  The incremental snapshot duplication stream could not be applied because
//          its starting snapshot did not match the final snapshot of the last
//          stream applied.
// *Action: Apply all the intermediate incremental data streams in the correct
//          order leading up to failed snap duplication stream and then rerun
//          the apply operation.
05925, 0, "unable to re-apply the initial snapshot duplication stream because its starting snapshot does not match the snapshot used to create the partially applied duplication stream"
// *Cause:  An attempt to apply an initial snapshot duplication stream was
//          interrupted. An attempt was then made to re-apply the initial
//          snapshot duplication stream. The re-apply failed because its
//          starting snapshot did not match the snapshot of the last,
//          partially applied snapshot duplication stream.
// *Action: Re-apply the correct initial snapshot duplication stream using the
//          -r option of the command 'acfsutil snap duplicate create'.
05926, 0, "The snapshot duplication stream cannot be applied because a previous duplication stream was interrupted."
// *Cause:  Snapshot duplication failed because a previously interrupted
//          snapshot duplication stream was detected.
// *Action: Generate a snapshot duplication stream using the -r option of the
//          command 'acfsutil snap duplicate create', and apply it.
//
05927, 0, "cannot synchronize the primary and standby replication sites"
// *Cause:  A request to synchronize the primary and standby replication sites
//          was rejected because the primary replication site was paused.
// *Action: Resume replication on the primary replication site and try to
//          synchronize the primary and standby replication sites again.
05928, 0,  "The ADVM compatibility attribute for the diskgroup is below the required version (%s) for the 'acfsutil snap duplicate' commands."
// *Cause:  The command 'acfsutil snap duplicate' was rejected because the ADVM
//          disk group compatibility attribute had not been upgraded to the
//          indicated version, which is required for that command.
// *Action: Use the Oracle ASM Configuration Assistant (ASMCA) tool or the
//          SQL ALTER DISKGROUP statement to upgrade the disk group
//          compatibility (COMPATIBLE.ADVM) attribute to the specified
//          version and then re-issue the original command.  If the disk
//          group compatibility attribute cannot be upgraded, update the ACFS
//          compatibility using the 'acfsutil compat set' command and then
//          re-issue the original command.
05929, 0, "Replication could not proceed because it was unable to delete a directory in mount point '%s' on standby node '%s'."
// *Cause:  The 'acfsutil snap dup apply' operation, as used by ACFS
//          replication, could not proceed because it was unable to delete a
//          directory in the indicated mount point on the standby replication
//          site shown.
// *Action: Check the alert log for message ACFS-05027 which includes the name
//          of the directory being deleted.  Check the standby cluster for
//          conditions that would prevent the directory from being deleted,
//          such as its being in use.  Replication will resume automatically
//          once the directory can be removed.
05930, 0, "A valid 'ssh' connection was detected for standby node %s as user %s."
05931, 0, "The standby replication ACFS file system mounted at path %s at site %s is not running a compatible version of replication."
// *Cause:  A request to upgrade a primary replication ACFS file system
//          was rejected because the standby file system is not running a
//          compatible version of replication.
// *Action: Ensure that the cluster where the standby replication ACFS file
//          system is located is running a version of Clusterware that supports
//          the version of ACFS replication to which upgrade was attempted.
//          Upgrade the standby replication ACFS file system, and then reissue

//          Refer to Oracle product documentation for details regarding
//          Clusterware and ACFS replication version compatibility.
05932, 0, "cannot upgrade the existing ACFS replication environment"
// *Cause:  A request to upgrade the existing ACFS replication environment to
//          snapshot-based replication was rejected because the existing tag
//          name list exceeded the limit of 4096 characters imposed by
//          snapshot-based replication.
// *Action: Terminate the existing replication environment and reconfigure using
//          snapshot-based replication.  Refer to Oracle product documentation
//          for details regarding upgrading to ACFS snapshot-based replication.
05933, 0, "invalid, out-of-date option given for 'acfsutil repl init'"
// *Cause:  An attempt to invoke a 'acfsutil repl init' command was rejected
//          because it specified an option specific to an earlier version
//          of ACFS replication.
// *Action: Ensure that you are using 'acfsutil repl init' as required
//          by the current version of ACFS replication.  Refer to the
//          Oracle product documentation for details about running current
//          replication.
05934, 0, "ACFS replication could not start an apply operation for mount point '%s' due to an existing apply operation."
// *Cause:  This message may indicate a problem with networking or storage
//          access that is preventing the existing apply operation from making
//          progress.  Alternatively, this message may indicate an internal
//          error.
// *Action: Contact Oracle Support Services.
05935, 0, "The ACFS replication primary is mounted on more than one node."
// *Cause:  A request to prepare ACFS replication for upgrade was rejected
//          because the file system was mounted on more than one node.
// *Action: Unmount the ACFS replication primary on all but one node and retry
//          the command.
05936, 0, "The new snapshot and the old snapshot do not have the same parent."
// *Cause:  An attempt to create a snap duplicate stream failed because the
//          snapshot specified as the old snapshot by the -i option did not
//          have the same parent as the snapshot specified as the new snapshot.
// *Action: Reissue the command with the correct snapshot names.
05937, 0, "The new snapshot is not a child of the parent snapshot."
// *Cause:  An attempt to create a snap duplicate stream failed because the
//          snapshot specified as the new snapshot was not a child of the
//          parent snap specified by the -p option.
// *Action: Reissue the command with the correct snapshot names.
05938, 0, "The new snapshot is not a child of the mount point."
// *Cause:  An attempt to create a snap duplicate stream failed because the
//          snapshot specified as the new snapshot was not a child of the
//          specified mount point.
// *Action: Reissue the command with the correct snapshot names.
05939, 0, "The parent snapshot must be writable."
// *Cause:  An attempt to create a snap duplicate stream failed because the
//          snapshot specified as the parent snapshot by the -p option was not
//          writable.
// *Action: Reissue the command specifying a writable parent snapshot.
05940, 0, "The ACFS file system mounted at path %s is not prepared for replication upgrade."
// *Cause:  A request to undo replication upgrade preparation on an ACFS file
//          system was rejected because the file system had not been prepared
//          for replication upgrade.
// *Action: If the indicated ACFS file system was not the intended target for
//          upgrade, reissue the command specifying the correct file system.
//          Otherwise no further action is necessary.
05941, 0, "The ACFS file system mounted at path %s may not be unprepared for replication upgrade."
// *Cause:  A request to undo replication upgrade preparation on an Oracle ACFS
//          file system was rejected because its standby file system had already
//          been upgraded.
// *Action: If the indicated Oracle ACFS file system was not the intended target
//          for upgrade, reissue the command specifying the correct file system.
//          Otherwise no further action is necessary.
05942, 0, "unable to apply updates to standby mount point '%s' due to user mismatch"
// *Cause:  An apply update operation on the indicated mount point was
//          rejected because the replication user for the primary mount
//          point and the indicated standby mount point did not match.  This
//          could occur if the command 'acfsutil repl update' had been used
//          to change the replication user for one mount point and not the
//          other.
// *Action: Run the 'acfsutil repl update' command for the mount point where
//          the intended replication user is not currently configured to
//          ensure that both mount points have the intended user configured.
05943, 0, "The replication user '%s' may lack needed privileges -- confirm the user's group memberships."
// *Cause:  The 'acfsutil repl init standby' command completed correctly and
//          registered the indicated user as specified by the -u option.
//          However additional validation by the command determined that the
//          indicated user was not a member of one or more groups presumed
//          necessary for subsequent correct functioning of replication.
// *Action: If the intended replication user was correctly specified, ensure
//          that that user is a member of the necessary groups, as specified
//          in the Oracle documentation, before continuing to initiate
//          replication.  If the indicated user is not the intended
//          replication user, then re-initialize the standby using the command
//          'acfsutil repl terminate standby' and then 'acfsutil repl init
//          standby' naming the intended user.
05944, 0, "The old and new snapshots are not properly related."
// *Cause:  An attempt to create a snap duplicate stream failed because the
//          specified new snapshot was not properly related to the old
//          snapshot specified with -i.  The new snapshot must either be a
//          child of the old snapshot or be a child of the same parent as the
//          old snapshot.
// *Action: Reissue the command specifying old and new snapshots with the
//          required relationship.
05945, 0, "Clusterware at site %s must be upgraded to support the standby replication ACFS file system mounted at path %s."
// *Cause:  Following an upgrade of the Oracle Clusterware on the cluster
//          where a primary replication ACFS file system was located, an
//          attempt to do an automatic update of the standby failed,
//          because the cluster where the standby replication ACFS file system
//          was located was not running the same version of Clusterware.
// *Action: Upgrade the Oracle Clusterware on the cluster where the standby
//          file system is located to ensure that the cluster is running the
//          same version of Clusterware as the cluster where the primary file
//          system is located.
05946, 0, "The replication subcommand (%s) is not supported by the version of replication configured on the file system or snapshot."
// *Cause:  An attempt to execute the indicated replication sub-command was
//          rejected because it was not supported by the configured replication
//          version.
// *Action: None.
05947, 0, "Snapshot %s must be writable."
// *Cause:  An attempt to initialize replication on a snapshot failed because
//          the snapshot specified was not writable.
// *Action: Reissue the command specifying a writable snapshot.
05948, 0, "The named standby is already in use by a different primary."
// *Cause:  An attempt to initialize replication failed because the
//          standby specified was already paired with a different primary.
// *Action: Reissue the command specifying a standby that is not in use.
//
05949, 0, "The standby replication ACFS file system mounted at path %s at site %s is not running a compatible version of replication."
// *Cause:  A request to initiate replication of an ACFS file system was
//          rejected because the indicated standby file system was running an
//          incompatible version of replication.
// *Action: Ensure that the cluster where the standby replication ACFS file
//          system is located is running a version of Clusterware that supports
//          the version of ACFS replication which was being initialized.
//          Initialize the standby replication ACFS file system, and then
//          reissue the command to initialize the primary ACFS replication file
//          system.  Refer to Oracle product documentation for details
//          regarding Clusterware and ACFS replication version compatibility.
05950, 0, "cannot reverse replication during a rolling upgrade"
// *Cause:  An attempt to reverse the replication role at a site was rejected
//          because the cluster was in a rolling upgrade.  Replication site
//          reversal is not allowed during a rolling upgrade.
// *Action: Complete the rolling upgrade and then reverse the replication site.
05951, 0, "snapshot creation is blocked while ACFS replication is updating the standby"
// *Cause: An attempt to create a snapshot could not complete immediately
//          because the replication standby was currently being updated
//          by ACFS replication.
// *Action: If the command has completed in the meantime, no action is
//          required.  Otherwise, if no action is taken, snapshot creation
//          will be retried periodically and complete once the ACFS
//          replication update has completed.  To complete the snapshot
//          creation immediately, interrupt the replication update and
//          reissue the command.  Terminiate the 'acfsutil snap create',
//          run 'acfsutil repl pause' on the replication primary to pause
//          the update, and then reissue 'acfsutil snap create'.  Finally,
//          run 'acfsutil repl resume' on the primary to resume the
//          replication update.
05952, 0, "A replication standby site cannot be reversed before the primary site is reversed."
// *Cause:  An attempt to reverse a replication standby site was rejected
//          because the corresponding replication primary site had not been
//          reversed before the attempted standby reversal.
// *Action: Reverse the replication primary site, then retry the operation.
05953, 0, "Replication on the remote site cannot be terminated from the local site."
// *Cause:  An attempt to terminate replication on the remote site from the
//          local site failed.
// *Action: On the remote replication cluster, verify replication is enabled,
//          the ASM instance is operational and the state of the file system
//          is healthy using 'acfsutil info fs'.
05954, 0, "Replication on the remote site cannot be terminated from the local site. Proceeding with local termination."
// *Cause:  An attempt to terminate replication on the remote site from the
//          local site failed.
// *Action: On the remote replication cluster, verify replication is enabled,
//          the ASM instance is operational and the state of the file system
//          is healthy using 'acfsutil info fs' before running 'acfsutil repl
//          terminate' on the remote cluster.
05955, 0, "The replication user '%s' specified using the '-s' option does not match the replication user configured on the standby."
// *Cause:  An attempt to initialize replication on the primary was rejected
//          because the replication user specified using the '-s' option does
//          not match the replication user specified with the 'acfsutil repl
//          init standby' command using the '-u' option.
// *Action: If the replication user configured on the standby is correct,
//          reissue the 'acfsutil repl init primary' command specifying it using
//          the '-s' option.  If the replication user configured on the standby
//          is incorrect, run 'acfsutil repl terminate' on the standby, and
//          rerun the 'acfsutil repl init' commands specifying the same user for
//          replication user on both the standby and primary using the '-u' and
//          '-s' options respectively.

10704, 0, "Snapshots exist for the file system mounted on '%s'. Encryption keys of files in these snapshots will not be rekeyed."
// *Cause: One or more snapshots existed for the file system when this encryption operation was done. The operation did
//         not rekey FEKs of files in any snapshots of the file system, so the FEKs of these files will continue to
//         remain encrypted with the old parameters. Note that none of the encryption commands affect files in any
//         snapshots.
// *Action: To ensure that all FEKs, including those of files in any snapshots, are encrypted with the new encryption
//          parameters, this command should be run when the file system has no snapshots. If the command was run when
//          some snapshots existed you may delete these snapshots. Any snapshots created after the command was run will

10705, 0, "Cannot perform encryption operation because volume encryption keys for the file system mounted at '%s' are not available."
// *Cause:  The encryption operation failed because the required volume encryption keys for the file system were not available to the ACFS file system driver.  This could happen because an incorrect key store password was supplied during mount or because of some other error during mount.

10706, 0, "Cannot perform encryption operation because an encryption undo operation is in progress."
// *Cause:  The encryption operation failed because the system administrator was running encryption undo ('acfsutil encr set -u') on the file system.  It is also possible that a previous encryption undo operation had not completed cleanly.
// *Action: There is no action to be taken by users who are not system administrators.  If this message is seen by a system administrator and an encryption undo operation is not in progress, then a previous encryption operation did not complete properly.  Run the 'acfsutil encr set -u' command again to complete the operation.
