# Description:
#		This is a meta file that contains a list of files which
#               contain OiD specific Auxiliary LDAP schema extensions required by
#               Oracle Products for release 8.2. A schema is called auxiliary
#		if it's origin is not from within Oracle but is neverthless
#		required for the function of Oracle products.

#		upon are:
#			Schema for storing Java objects (defined by Sun)

#
#  Notes:
#	   It is possible that the schema to be loaded by the files here
#	   already exists in the target directory. In that case, it is
#	   better to make ldapmodify ignore the errors it encounters 
#	   while loading the schema.
#
#          This LDIF file will only work with Oracle Internet Directory
#               version 2.0.6 and above
#
#          This file should  be loaded by 'ldapmodify' with the following
#           options "-c -a -v"
