# Description:
#	This meta-file contains the list of LDIF templates 
#	that should be used to create an oracle context
#	for 8.2 release. The LDIF files listed here contain
#	substitution patterns which should be instantiated 
#	with the DN of the user as well as the root of the
#	OracleContext file before loading them into OiD

# Modified:

#
#
#   Notes:  
#
#          This LDIF file will only work with Oracle Internet Directory
#               version 2.0.5 and above
#
#          This file should  be loaded by 'ldapmodify' with the following 
#           options "-c -v" 

# currently all context creation happens using one file.
