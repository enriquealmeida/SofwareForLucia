# Notes: 
#       This script creates the common structures for all subscribers.
#       It gets invoked in all of the following cases:
#        a) creation of the default subscriber for testing and installations
#        b) creation of a new subscriber during hosted application runtime
#        c) designating an existing entry as a subscriber by a deployment
#        d) designating an existing entry as a subscriber during OID upgrade
#
#       Currently this script does the following:
#        - creates the subscriber specific oracle context
#        - marks the subscriber entry as an 'orclSubscriber'
#        - grants administrative privileges to certain groups in the root 
#           oracle context for controlling user/group administration.
#
#       Since this script is used for all cases, it does not create any 
#       additional DIT elements like user/group container or setup ACLs
#       that may conflict with existing deployment practices. All such
#       changes are performed by oidSubscriberCreateAuxDIT.sbs script
#       instead.
#         
#  This script requires the following substitution variables:
#       %s_SubscriberDN% : the DN of the subscriber entry
#       %s_OracleContextDN%: the DN of the subscriber specific oracle context.
#                              (usually cn=oracleContext,%s_SubscriberDN%)
#       %s_RootOracleContextDN% : the DN of the root Oracle Context. 
#                               (almost always cn=oraclecontext)
#       %s_CurrentUserDN% : the DN of the user who is going to 
#                               be loading the LDIF file into the
#                               directory.
#       %s_OracleContextParentDN% : the DN of the parent entry of the 
#                                     OracleContext. This is the same as 
#                                                the DN of the subscriber.
