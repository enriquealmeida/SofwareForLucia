1025, 0, "Oracle Clusterware was upgraded to version [%s] on all nodes, but the cluster active version is still [%s]. Details in [%s]."
// *Cause: The cluster upgrade did not complete because the root upgrade script
//         failed on the last node, the root upgrade script was interrupted by
//         the user, or the cluster upgrade is ongoing.
// *Action: Check the Oracle Clusterware alert log on all nodes for any
//          problems. Rerun the root upgrade script on the last node to 
//          completion, and ensure that the cluster active version has 
//          changed using the 'crsctl query crs activeversion' command. If the 
//          problem persists, run diagcollection.pl and contact Oracle Support 
//          Services.

// *Action: Ensure that the backup location exists, that it is mounted 
//          correctly and visible to all nodes in the cluster, and that the
//          permissions are correct. If the backup location is an 
//          ASM disk group, check the ASM entries in the alert log file for 
//          more details.
1029, 0, "The Oracle Cluster Registry backup file %s is corrupt. Details at %s in %s." 
// *Cause: The backup file created by the periodic backup of the Oracle Cluster
//         Registry (OCR) failed to pass the post-backup sanity check.  
//         Either the OCR was corrupted or the backup was faulty. 
// *Action: If the fault was introduced during the backup generation, then it
//          will be corrected during the next backup generation, and no action
//          is required. If the subsequent backup is also faulty, then the 
//          Oracle Cluster Registry might be corrupt. Contact Oracle 
//          Support Services.
1030, 0, "The Oracle Cluster Registry backup file %s could not be validated. Details at %s in %s." 
// *Cause: The indicated Oracle Cluster Registry (OCR) backup file 
//         could not be validated due to validation process not starting or 
//         failing to run the validation check.
// *Action: If the backup was attempted as part of an automatic periodic backup, 
//          then no action is needed. If the backup was attempted as part of a 
//          manual backup, then try the backup again.
//          If the problem persists, contact Oracle Support Services.
1031, 0, "The Oracle Cluster Registry operation encountered ASM error. Details at %s in %s." 
// *Cause: The Oracle Cluster Registry (OCR) operation could not be completed
//         due to the referenced ASM errors.
// *Action: Check the referenced log file for more detailed failure 
//          information.

1706, 0, "Found %d of %d voting files in a pending configuration change but %d voting files are required, terminating to ensure data integrity; details at %s in %s"
// *Cause:  The voting file discovery was unable to locate a sufficient
//          number of voting files from the new configuration when a
//          configuration change to add or delete voting files is in
//          progress.  The CSS daemon is terminating to avoid potential
//          data corruption.
// *Action: Delete the voting files that are no longer available, as 
//          indicated by message number 1638, using appropriate 'crsctl'

// *Action: Add at lease one voting file using appropriate crsctl command.

1710,0,"Lease acquisition failed for node %s because CSSD failed to access majority of voting files; Details at %s in %s"
// *Cause:  A majority of the voting files are not accessible by a node.
// *Action: Delete the voting files that are no longer available, as 
//          indicated by message number 1637, using appropriate 'crsctl'
//          commands, run either on another node where the Clusterware

//          exclusive mode.

1711,0,"Increasing the number of leases available for new nodes from %d to %d"
// *Cause:  All the currently available leases are being used.
//          Hence the number of leases available are increased.
// *Action: None

1712,0,"Failed to save the node number acquired for node %s; Details at %s in %s"
// *Cause:  CSSD failed to save the node number acquired during startup.
//          The node number is saved to speed up the subsequent startup.
//          Hence this is not a real problem but just a performance degradation
//          on the next startup.
// *Action: Collect Clusterware alert log, CSSD logs and OHASD logs indicated 
//          in the message and contact Oracle Support Services.

1713,0,"CSSD daemon is started in %s mode"
// *Cause:  CSSD has been started on the node.
// *Action: None

1714,0,"Unable to discover any voting files, retrying discovery in %d seconds; Details at %s in %s"
//  *Cause: No voting files were discovered.  Possible reasons include:
//          - The filesystems the voting files are on are not available
//          - The voting files have been deleted
//          - The voting files are corrupted
//  *Action: Verify that the filesystems that the voting files are on 
//           are active and that the voting files have not been damaged.
//           If necessary, start the clusterware stack in exclusive mode
//           using 'crsctl start crs -excl' and add voting files using
//           'crsctl add css votedisk' or 'crsctl replace votedisk'

  

1715,0,"A failure occurred in the CSS daemon during initialization; Details at %s in %s"
// *Cause:  A fatal error occurred during the initialization of the CSS daemon.
// *Action: Check for prior errors logged in the alert log. Correct any
//          errors that can be corrected.  If there are no errors shown,
//          or the errors cannot be resolved, contact Oracle Support
//          Services

1716,0,"The CSS daemon cannot join the cluster because the software version %s is lower than the active version %s; Details at %s in %s"
// *Cause:  The cluster has been upgraded to the active version indicated.
//          in the message, but this node is at a lower software version,
//          as indicated in the message.
// *Action: Upgrade this node to the active version indicated in the message

1717,0,"The CSS daemon has detected a voting file add during startup and is waiting for the add to complete; Details at %s in %s"
// *Cause:  A voting file add started on another node is in progress while
//          this CSS daemon is starting.  To avoid the potential for data
//          corruption, the CSS daemon on this node must wait for the add
//          to complete.
// *Action: This is normally a temporary condition that is automatically
//          resolved. If the clusterware stack cannot start on any node,
//          this condition may be corrected by starting the clusterware
//          stack in exclusive mode using 'crsctl start crs -excl' 
//          followed by 'crsctl stop crs' on one node.  This will
//          automatically correct the condition and the clusterware can
//          be started normally on all nodes.
/
1718,0,"The CSS daemon is unable to continue due to a failure in required component %s."
// *Cause:  A component required by the Cluster Synchronization Service
//          (CSS) daemon has failed.  The CSS daemon is unable to
//          continue and is failing.

// *Cause:  Excessive system load has prevented threads in the Cluster
//          Synchronization Service daemon (CSSD) from being scheduled for
//          execution for the time indicated in the message. This indicates
//          the system is overloaded. 
// *Action: Take steps to reduce the system load or increase system 
//          resources to handle the load.  
/
1720,0,"Cluster Synchronization Services daemon (CSSD) is ready for operation."
// *Cause:  Cluster Synchronization Services daemon (CSSD) is fully initialized
//          and functional. CSSD group membership services has started.
//          Services dependent on CSSD can start using cluster synchronization
//          services.
// *Action: None.
1721,0,"Cluster Synchronization Service daemon (CSSD) was unable to complete initialization for fence type %s."
// *Cause:  The Cluster Synchronization Service daemon (CSSD) failed to complete
//          initialization for the indicated fence type, most likely because of
//          a failure in the associated support entity. The entities CSSD 
//          depends on are ASM, DISKMON. Messages in the alert log from DISKMON 
//          or ASM may supply additional details.

//          The accompanying message provides additional details on 
//          failed system call.
// *Action: Contact Oracle Support Services. 
/
1724,0,"CSSD agent failed to spawn CSSD process"
// *Cause:  The Cluster Synchronization Services daemon could not be started 
//          because the operating system failed to spawn the process. 
// *Action: Contact Oracle Support Services. 
/
1725,0,"Encountered operating system error '%s' while performing operation '%s'."
// *Cause:  The operating system encountered an error for the indicated operation.

1728, 0, "The majority of voting files are accessible on %d sites, however %d sites are required, terminating to ensure data integrity; details at %s in %s"

// *Cause:  A check on voting file accessibility prompted by a voting file 
//          management operation, periodic voting file access or lease 
//          acquisition determined that a majority of voting files on a 
//          majority of sites were not accessible by the local node.

// *Action: Delete the voting files that are no longer available, as 
//          indicated by message CRS-01637, using the appropriate 'crsctl'
//          commands. Run the crsctl command either on another node where the
//          clusterware stack is active, or by starting the clusterware 
//          stack in exclusive mode.

1729, 0, "CSSD failed to start because the clusterware stack was not shutdown in the expected manner."
// *Cause: The possible reasons include:
//         - A clusterware stack shutdown in Zero Downtime GI Patching mode was
//           not issued prior to this start attempt
//         - A clusterware stack shutdown in Zero Downtime GI Patching mode was 
//           issued but it failed
// *Action: Restart the clusterware stack normally without the 
//          Zero Downtime GI Patching mode option.

1730,0,"Cluster Synchronization Service daemon failed to change process priority due to an operating system error '%s'."
// *Cause:  An attempt to change the process priority failed.
// *Action: Contact Oracle Support Services.

/
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

2401, 0, "The Cluster Time Synchronization Service started on host %s."
// *Cause: The Cluster Time Synchronization Service successfully started on the
//         listed node.
// *Action: None.
/
2402, 0, "The Cluster Time Synchronization Service aborted on host %s. Details at %s in %s."
// *Cause:  The Cluster Time Synchronization Service aborted due to an internal
//          error. Check the Cluster Time Synchronization Service log file to
//          determine the cause.
// *Action: Determine whether the Cluster Time Synchronization Service has
//          auto-started.
/
2403, 0, "The Cluster Time Synchronization Service on host %s is in observer mode."
// *Cause: The Cluster Time Synchronization Service detected an active vendor time
//         synchronization service on at least one node in the cluster.
// *Action: Oracle Clusterware requires a time synchronization service in active
//          mode. Oracle Clusterware will work with a vendor service or the Cluster
//          Time Synchronization Service. If you want to change the Cluster Time
//          Synchronization Service to active mode, stop and deconfigure the vendor
//          time synchronization service on all nodes.
/
2404, 0, "The Cluster Time Synchronization Service detects that the local time is significantly different from the mean cluster time. Details in %s."
// *Cause: The difference between the local time and the time on the reference
//         node was too much to be corrected.
// *Action: Shutdown the Oracle Clusterware on the local node. Adjust the
//          clock via native platform or OS methods. Restart the Oracle
//          Clusterware on the local node. 
/
2405, 0, "The Cluster Time Synchronization Service on host %s is shutdown by user"
// *Cause: The Cluster Time Synchronization Service on listed node was
//         terminated by a user.
// *Action: None.
/
2406, 0, "The Cluster Time Synchronization Service timed out on host %s. Details in %s."
// *Cause:  A Cluster Time Synchronization Service action failed. The
//          information from the reference node was discarded.
// *Action: Verify all network connections between cluster nodes and repair any
//          problematic connections. If no network problems are found,
//          1. Run diagcollection.pl.
//          2. Contact Oracle Support Services.

// *Cause:  The clock was updated to be in sync with the mean cluster time.
// *Action: None.
/
2409, 0, "The clock on host %s differs from mean cluster time by %d microseconds. No action has been taken because the Cluster Time Synchronization Service is running in observer mode."
// *Cause: The system clock on the indicated host differed from the mean 
//         cluster time by more than 1000 microseconds. No action was taken 
//         because the Cluster Time Synchronization Service was running in 
//         observer mode.
// *Action: Verify correct operation of the vendor time synchronization service
//          on the node.
/
2410, 0, "The Cluster Time Synchronization Service on host %s is in active mode."
// *Cause: The Cluster Time Synchronization Service did not detect an active
//         vendor time synchronization service on any node in the cluster.
// *Action: None. If a vendor time synchronization service is preferred to the
//          Cluster Time Synchronization Service, then configure and start the
//          vendor time synchronization service on all nodes to change the
//          Cluster Time Synchronization Service to observer mode.
/
2411, 0, "The Cluster Time Synchronization Service will take a long time to perform time synchronization as local time is significantly different from mean cluster time. Details in %s."
// *Cause: The difference between the local time and the time on the reference
//         node was too much to be synchronized in a short period.
// *Action: (Optional) Shutdown and restart the Oracle Clusterware on this node
//          to instantaneously synchronize the time with the reference node.
/
2412, 0, "The Cluster Time Synchronization Service detects that the local time is significantly different from the mean cluster time. Details in %s."
// *Cause: The difference between the local time and the time on the reference
//         node was too large. No action has been taken as the Cluster Time
//         Synchronization Service was running in observer mode.
// *Action: Verify correct operation of the vendor time synchronization service
//          on the node. Alternatively, if you want to change the Cluster
//          Time Synchronization Service to active mode, stop and
//          deconfigure the vendor time synchronization service on all nodes.
/
2413, 0, "The Cluster Time Synchronization Service is unable to perform step time synchronization due to high network latency with the reference node. The local time is not significantly different from the mean cluster time. The Cluster Time Synchronization Service is entering slew time synchronization mode."
// *Cause: The Cluster Time Synchronization Service experienced high network
//         latency. The local time was not significantly different from the
//         mean cluster time; therefore, the Cluster Time Synchronization
//         Service will maintain the system time with slew time synchronization.
// *Action: Determine the root cause of high network latency, and perform
//          appropriate repair if necessary.
/
2414, 0, "The Cluster Time Synchronization Service is unable to perform step time synchronization due to high network latency with the reference node. The local time is significantly different from the mean cluster time. The Cluster Time Synchronization Service is aborting."
// *Cause: The Cluster Time Synchronization Service experienced high network
//         latency. The local time was significantly different from the mean
//         cluster time; therefore, the Cluster Time Synchronization Service is
//         aborting.
// *Action: Shut down the Oracle Clusterware on the local node. Determine the
//          root cause of high network latency. Perform appropriate repair if
//          necessary, then restart the Oracle Clusterware on the local node.
/
2415, 1, "Resource '%s' cannot be registered because its owner '%s' is not the same as the Oracle Restart user '%s'."

/
2417, 0, "The Cluster Time Synchronization Service is in active mode."
// *Cause: The Cluster Time Synchronization Service did not detect an active
//         vendor time synchronization service on any node in the cluster.
// *Action: None. If a vendor time synchronization service is preferred to the
//          Cluster Time Synchronization Service, then configure and start the

2418, 0, "The clock on host %(1)s differs from mean cluster time by %(2)lu microseconds. The Cluster Time Synchronization Service will not perform time synchronization because the time difference is beyond the permissible offset of %(3)lu seconds. Details in %(4)s."
// *Cause: The Cluster Time Synchronization Service exited because it detected
//         a time offset from mean cluster time on the indicated node of more
//         than the indicated permissible value.
// *Action: Shutdown Oracle Clusterware on the indicated host. Adjust the

// *Action: Re-evaluate the request and if it makes sense, set the force option and
//          re-submit.
2530, 1, "Unable to stop '%s' because '%s' has a stop-time '%s' dependency on it"
// *Cause:  Stopping the resource is impossible because it has a dependency

// *Cause: An attempt to start a resource on a server failed because the server
//         needed the indicated additional memory to satisfy the memory
//         requirements of the resource.
// *Action: Change the placement policy of the resource to expand the server
//          selections, change the memory requirement of the resource, or add
//          more memory to the server to which the resource is directly
//          assigned.
/
2965, 1, "cannot run resource '%(1)s' on server '%(2)s' because the server needs %(3)d additional CPUs"
// *Cause: An attempt to start a resource on a server failed because the server
//         needed additional CPUs to satisfy the CPU requirement of the
//         resource.
// *Action: Change the placement policy of the resource to expand the server
//          selections, change the CPU requirement of the resource, or add more
//          CPUs to the server to which the resource is directly assigned.
/
2966, 1, "There are no servers satisfying the placement policy for resource '%s'."
// *Cause: An attempt to start a resource on servers that were available
//         according to the placement policy failed because none of those
//         servers could satisfy the requirements of the resource.
// *Action: Change the placement policy of the resource to expand the server

// *Cause:  An attempt to start the CSS daemon in exclusive mode failed because
//          an active CSS daemon was detected on the indicated node. Starting
//          CSS in exclusive mode requires that the clusterware stack be down on

08000, 0, "unable to obtain local host name for reboot advisory log file scan"
// *Cause:  An attempt to retrieve the local host name failed.  The scan
//          for reboot advisory files will not use host name criteria and so
//          may report occurrences for other nodes as well as this one.
// *Action: Report this error to Oracle Support Services.
/

08001, 0, "an error occurred accessing reboot advisory log file location: %s"
// *Cause:  The scan for reboot advisory log files was unable to access the
//          indicated file system location.  The location was skipped, so
//          any reboot advisory files that it contains will not be reported.
//          This message is accompanied by CLSU- messages containing
//          details of the access error.
// *Action: Respond based on the error described by the accompanying CLSU-

//          changing its permissions.
/

08002, 0, "an error occurred searching reboot advisory log file location: %s"
// *Cause:  The scan for reboot advisory log files was unable to read the next

//          messages.
/

08003, 0, "reboot advisory log file: %s is unexpectedly empty"
// *Cause:  The scan for reboot advisory log files encountered a file that

//          initializing its use of reboot advisory at the same time the scan
//          is running.  Processing of other files in the location continues.
// *Action: Frequent occurrence of this message should be reported to
//          Oracle Support Services.
/

08004, 0, "an error occurred reading reboot advisory log file: %s"
// *Cause:  The scan for reboot advisory log files experienced a read error
//          on a reboot advisory file.  No further processing is done for that
//          file, but the scan continues with other files.  This message

//          read error.
// *Action: Respond based on the accompanying CLSU- messages.
/

08005, 0, "an error occurred closing reboot advisory log file: %s"
// *Cause:  The scan for reboot advisory log files experienced a close error on

// *Action: Report this error to Oracle Support Services.
/

08006, 0, "an error occurred opening reboot advisory log file: %s"
// *Cause:  The scan for reboot advisory log files experienced an error when it

//          This message is accompanied by CLSU- messages containing details
//          of the open error.
// *Action: If the error indicated in the accompanying CLSU- messages is one that
//          can be corrected, do so.  Otherwise, report this error to Oracle
//          Support Services.
/

08007, 0, "an error occurred closing reboot advisory log file location: %s"
// *Cause:  The scan for reboot advisory log files experienced an error when it
//          closed the indicated file system location.  Processing of other
//          reboot advisory locations (if any) continues normally.
//          This message is accompanied by CLSU- messages containing
//          details of the close error.
// *Action: Report this error to Oracle Support Services.
/

08008, 0, "%s"
// *Cause:  Operating system error data related to reboot advisory file
//          processing was returned.  The error data is packaged in a CLSU- message
//          that follows "CRS-08008:".  One or more of these messages
//          appears after a message announcing the error condition.
// *Action: Look up the embedded CLSU- message for an explanation of the
//          operating system error data.  If there is no CLSU- message ID present,
//          contact Oracle Support Services.
/

08009, 0, "reboot advisory log file: %s contains invalid data (length %d, error code %d)"
// *Cause:  A reboot advisory log record read from the indicated file contained
//          incorrect data.
// *Action: Report this error to Oracle Support Services.
/

08010, 0, "invalid network reboot advisory message detected (length %d, error code %d)"
// *Cause:  A reboot advisory record received over the network was improperly
//          formed or contained incorrect data.
// *Action: Report this error to Oracle Support Services.
/

08011, 0, "reboot advisory message from host: %s, component: %s, with time stamp: %s"
// *Cause:  A reboot advisory message was detected.  During Oracle Clusterware
//          startup on a given host, messages recently written to disk on that host
//          before a reset or reboot are detected and announced.  Subsequently,
//          network reboot advisory messages may be announced as they occur.  These
//          are reported by hosts other than the one being reset or rebooted.
//          This message is accompanied by other messages containing details on
//          what led to the reset or reboot.  The time stamp in this message
//          begins with either 'U' (denoting UTC time) or 'L' (denoting
//          local time as viewed by the issuing host).  Note that a given
//          reset or reboot event can produce multiple occurrences of these
//          messages on multiple hosts in the cluster.
// *Action: Use the reboot advisory message(s) to determine why Oracle Clusterware
//          caused a reset or reboot of the affected host, and respond
//          accordingly.  Refer to the discussion of reboot advisories in the
//          Oracle Clusterware administration documentation for additional
//          guidance.
/

08012, 0, "reboot advisory message from a higher Oracle Clusterware version detected"
// *Cause:  A reboot advisory message from a higher version installation of
//          Oracle Clusterware was detected.  This is an expected
//          occurrence with network reboot advisories when there are nodes with
//          a higher Oracle Clusterware version than this node (such as during
//          an upgrade).  It is an unexpected condition with file reboot
//          advisories.
// *Action: The reboot advisory message is displayed in a following CRS-08013
//          message in a "raw" text form.  In the case of network reboot
//          advisories, the explanatory message text should be readable and
//          useful to determine the cause of the node reboot.  If the
//          reboot advisory message is from a file, report this message to
//          Oracle Support Services.
/

08013, 0, "reboot advisory message text: %s"
// *Cause:  An explanatory text message associated
//          with a reboot advisory announced in a preceding CRS-08011 or CRS-08012
//          message was displayed.  These text messages are always written in US English
//          locale.
// *Action: Refer to the descriptions of messages CRS-08011 and -08012, and
//          to the Oracle Clusterware documentation on reboot advisories.
/

08014, 0, "reboot advisory binary data (%d bytes%s) follows:"
// *Cause:  Binary data associated with a reboot advisory message was displayed.
//          It is followed by one or more lines of CRS-08015 message containing
//          the binary data formatted in hexadecimal.  If an asterisk appears
//          inside the parentheses, an invalid data length was detected.
// *Action: Refer to the description of message CRS-08011 and -08012, and
//          to the Oracle Clusterware documentation on reboot advisories.
/

08015, 0, "%04X    %s"
// *Cause:  Hexadecimal display of binary data included in a reboot advisory log
//          message was displayed.  The first number is an offset and is
//          followed by up to 16 bytes of data.
// *Action: Refer to the description of message CRS-08011 and -08012, and
//          to the Oracle Clusterware documentation on reboot advisories.
/

08016, 0, "an error occurred determining the location for reboot advisory log files"
// *Cause:  The search for reboot advisory log files was unable to determine
//          the file system location used for those files.  Processing
//          of reboot advisory files is skipped.  This message is accompanied
//          by CLSU- messages containing failure details.
//          This is an internal error.
// *Action: Report this error to Oracle Support Services.
/

08017, 0, "location: %s has %d reboot advisory log files, %d were announced and %d errors occurred"
// *Cause:  This summary message is written during Oracle Clusterware startup if
//          one or more reboot advisory log files was found and examined.
// *Action: This message is informational, but if the error count is nonzero
//          the associated messages (earlier in the alert log) should be examined.
/

08018, 0, "warning: missing cluster identity data for reboot advisory message validation"
// *Cause:  During Oracle Clusterware start up, an attempt to obtain the identity of
//          the cluster failed.  Processing continues normally, but network
//          reboot advisories from nodes in other clusters may be reported in
//          this cluster's alert log.
// *Action: Report this error to Oracle Support Services.

08019, 0, "warning generated by the initialization of the reboot advisory in the CSS agent, %s"

// *Action: Report this warning to Oracle Support Services.

08020, 0, "error generated by the initialization of the reboot advisory in the CSS agent, %s"
